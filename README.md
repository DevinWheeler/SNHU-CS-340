## Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
In my work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, I focused on creating clean, modular, and well-documented code. This made it easy to use with the dashboard widgets in Project Two. The modular design allows for easy updates and reuse in future projects.

## Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist
I approached the Grazioso Salvare project by breaking down the requirements into small tasks and prioritizing them. This project required integrating both the database backend and dashboard frontend, which taught me the importance of development and testing. I plan to use these strategies in future projects to ensure scalable and flexible solutions.

## The Role of a Computer Scientist
Computer scientists design and build systems that solve real-world problems. My work on the Grazioso Salvare dashboard helps the company make better decisions, improving their services. This project highlights how technology can streamline operations and enhance business outcomes.
